All my data science projects are here. I started coding in 2022 when Nigerian Universities where on an 8-month strike.
Honestly it has been a pick and drop journeyn for me, motivating myself to get something done a day is a very tasking job because i had uni work and a job on the side to get monthly stipends 
i dont have anything else to say, enjoy yourself and i will continue to work on myself day by day
